# Python Capstone Project: COVID-19 Analysis
# Introduction
This project is part of my Python capstone organized by 3MTT. It involves analyzing a COVID-19 dataset obtained from Kaggle. The objective is to gain insights into the data and demonstrate skills in Python programming, data analysis, and visualization. This project serves as a significant milestone in my learning journey.
